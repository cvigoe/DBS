# Parkinsonian Tremor Simulation with DBS

![DBS Simulation](https://github.com/cvigoe/DBS/blob/master/simulation.gif)

Simulation of the effects of various forms of Deep Brain Stimulation using a control-theory model of Parkinsonian tremor proposed by Davidson et al.
See DBS.pdf for an in-depth report on the simulation.
